# mensago-utils

A collection of miscellaneous Mensago-related utility scripts.

## Description

The main purpose behind this package is `mdshell`, a shell for Mensago development -- mostly interactively exercising pymensago. It was originally thought that Smilodon, an upcoming command-line Mensago client, would eliminate the need for this shell, but both are actually needed.

## Status

The application is in early development. It currently uses a REPL style command environment and can handle account registration and login. 

## Building

There's not much to see here at this point unless you're actively involved in the development of the Mensago platform. Still, you might find some useful tools here, too.
